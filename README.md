### Notes

Some challenges that I had was understanding how Parcels worked after watching the guide videos. I had to actually go back and read the notes Codepath has on the subject.

   - [X] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [X] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had some challenges that came with adding dependencies correctly at the beginning of the project. I was getting some errors associated with not having the correct dependencies, 
and the API used didn't match up with the XML of Main Activity.
I was also reading on documentation and found quite confusing when it came to understanding RecyclerView, Adapters, and how it all tied together. The resources provided by Codepath definitely helped!
